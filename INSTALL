== Disclaimer ==

There is no guarantee that any of the Page Forms functionality will
work on your system. On the other hand, the code does not make any
modifications to the database directly, so it should be a low-risk
installation.

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

== Requirements ==

The extension requires MediaWiki 1.23 or greater.

== Installation ==

(1) Extract the archive to obtain the directory "PageForms" that contains
    all relevant files. Copy this directory (or extract/download it) to
    "[wikipath]/extensions/".
(2) Insert either one of the following lines into the file
    "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
        include_once('extensions/PageForms/PageForms.php');
        wfLoadExtension( 'PageForms' );
