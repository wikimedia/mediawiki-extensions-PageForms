== About ==

Page Forms is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for the
creation and usage of forms to add and edit semantic data. It can
work in conjuction with two other extensions that both handle the
storage of data: Semantic MediaWiki and Cargo.

For much more information on Page Forms, see the extension
homepage at https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Page_Forms

Notes on installing Page Forms can be found in the file INSTALL.
